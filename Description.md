# Varuna-Water-Quality-Index

Varuna is a Python-based system designed to calculate water quality indices, including the Canadian Water Quality Index and the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) Water Quality Index. Inspired by Varuna, the Hindu god associated with water and the celestial ocean, this project aims to promote sustainable water management and ensure the safety of our precious water resources. With Varuna, I am leveraging the capabilities of Python to create a user-friendly tool that empowers researchers, scientists, and water quality enthusiasts to accurately assess the health of their local water bodies. The system incorporates a comprehensive range of physical, chemical, and biological parameters to calculate the water quality index scores. By combining multiple parameters, Varuna provides a holistic assessment of water quality, enabling us to identify potential issues and prioritize appropriate actions.
